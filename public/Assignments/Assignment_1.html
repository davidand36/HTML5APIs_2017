    <h1>HTML5 APIs Assignment 1: Number Form</h1>

    <p>
      Create a Web page with an input field where the user enters numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time the user enters a number, update the display to show how many numbers have been entered, the sum of the numbers, and the average (mean) of the numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be a Reset button that allows the user to start over with a new sequence of numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what the page might look like, before you do much styling:<br/>
      <img src="NumberForm1.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Use <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1105441/assignments" target="_blank">Canvas</a> to submit the URL to your Web page.
