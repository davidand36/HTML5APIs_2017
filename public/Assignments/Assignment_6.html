    <h1>HTML5 APIs Assignment 6: Local Storage</h1>

    <p>
      Create a Web app like the one for the Object List assignment with a table for the items and a form for creating and editing them. The only difference is that instead of just keeping the database in an array in your app's memory, you will also use <code>localStorage</code> to store the data, reading from it at start-up and saving to it whenever data changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need just one property in <code>localStorage</code> for your entire database, a JSON version of your array of objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table might look like this: <br/>
      <img src="CrudAppTable.png" /> <br/>
      Your form might look something like this: <br/>
      <img src="CrudAppForm.png" />
    </p>
